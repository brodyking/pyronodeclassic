# Pyronode (Classic)
This respitory is the classic version of pyronode.us
This includes user accounts and logins because I dont feel like removing them.

## User accounts
All of the user accounts are stored in the logins.js file. They are linked with basic html encryption. 
All user accounts are stored in the /accounts/ directory. When the website was active, the website would use .htaccess as a 2FA.

## Games
All games are made with Wick Editor and exported to HTML5/JS3.

## Forum
The forum was made with MicroTXT
