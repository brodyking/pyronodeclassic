           I am going to be making a new game soon. I want to make a more explorer game kinda thing. I think it could be cool.
            Maybe if it was kinda like the old pokemon games on the gameboy or DS Lite. 
            
            It would not have pokemon or anytihng like that but it would still be kidna that same idea.

            Monkey Jumper is now online. You can play it on the homepage. It
            only has 8 levels I think but it is fun and working so yeah.
            If you want to play it head over there and click 'play game.'
            It is under klicker still as it sorts by popualarity.

             I am working on seting up a alternate domain that uses the same file
            directory and lets you connect on school wifi. The domain (pyronode.us)
            is blocked by many internet connections and blocks. So this method
            would work better. I will keep you guys posted on how this works out.
            If you guys have any questions please email me.

             I saw a thread on /mt/ which talks about me not being active on the
            fourms anymore. And I need to talk about this in this thread. 
            
            The main reason I dont use the forums anymore is that it is annoying
            . I dont like having to go on there every day and post somthing or 
            respond to the 1 post there is where it is just complaining. 
            
            Another reason is that the forum is inactive. only like 10 unique 
            ip's have connected to the fourm in the last 30 days. And only 4 of 
            those IP adresses posted somthing. So that tells me no one really 
            uses the forum.
            
            So basicaly I am shutting down the forums later today. I dont know 
            when but yeah. Anyways I hope you will just start
            <a href="mailto:bk.2k@hotmail.com" class="green nav">emailing me</a> like I said
            from the start... Yeesh.

        Alright so I have been working like all night on my game and i just
            got the worst news ever. I had wrote my old gravity/movments all by
            myself in javascript. But now I have to redo the entire engine
            because I messed up the jumping.

 Welcome to my board! I have disabled replying and posting as I am
            only going to have this board as a way to post updates about games
            and to store game files.
<br><br>
            <span class="green">> Please note this is a temparary solution</span>
<br><br>
            I will most likly setup somthing like wordpress or textpattern in
            the coming days as sing imageboard software is a pain. Although I
            may keep it being a imageboard because all I have to do it just go
            to mod.js and post. No need to go into some HTML file and manualy
            change stuff. Tell me what you guys personaly like on
            the forums. I know some people are
            going to ask about what imageboard software I am using, and I will
            write all about that here. I am using a custom-written software made
            in javascript without MySQL or PHP. Its a simple open without apache
            or anything app. There are lots of securiy issues though. I had to
            protect the mod file with .htpass to just so no one could get into
            it.
